### Day 1: January 2, 2018 

**Today's Focus**: Begin learning [FSharp.Data](http://fsharp.github.io/FSharp.Data/) library.

**Details**:

 - Playing with [Html Type Provider](http://fsharp.github.io/FSharp.Data/library/HtmlProvider.html) to scrape Vikings episode information (seasons 1-3 in initial attempt) from Wikipedia.
 - Html Type Provider allows you to get compile time type safety and Intellisense from a live website (creates types behind the scenes and explores the HTML as you type)!
 - Great way to explore APIs.

**Examples**: Here is an example of the type provider in action, while it scrapes html information from the season 1 Wikipedia page. I'm able to access html, lists and tables on the fly and then access elements within those structures. Pretty neat stuff! [This](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vikings_(season_1)#Episodes) is the table I'm accessing from Wikipedia. Also, notice how useful the F# Interactive window is to test your code as your write it :open_mouth:

### Day 2: January 3, 2018

**Today's Focus**: Continue learning [FSharp.Data](http://fsharp.github.io/FSharp.Data/) library.

**Details**:

 - Refactored some of the Vikings episode Wikipedia scraper code. I figured out how to pass the [Html Type Provider](http://fsharp.github.io/FSharp.Data/library/HtmlProvider.html) as a parameter in a function so I could make some code reuse. Instead of instantiating one per season directly, I wrapped the type, providing the season 1 table as sample data. Then I used the *Load* function to create each season. Changes can be seen [here](https://github.com/jasondown/FunWithFSharpData/commit/0e79445abaa236e128384db03ff4080d425d7198). *NOTE: There was a bug in the refactored code where all episodes were being reported as season 1. This has been fixed*.
 - Created another example using the [JSON Type Provider](http://fsharp.github.io/FSharp.Data/library/JsonProvider.html) and the free [IEX Trading API](https://iextrading.com/developer/docs/#getting-started) to grab a bunch of *tech giant* stock quote information and display the current trading price. Again, you get Intellisense from the JSON returned from the API.

**Examples**: Here is an animated GIF showing the stock quote code in use with F# Interactive:

### Day 3: January 4, 2018

**Today's Focus**: Continue learning [FSharp.Data](http://fsharp.github.io/FSharp.Data/) library.

**Details**:

 - Looking at the [XML Type Provider](http://fsharp.github.io/FSharp.Data/library/XmlProvider.html) to get compile time safety for XML data.
 -  I created a sample RSS reader to print N number of recent article summaries.
 - Also played with [partial function application](https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/posts/partial-application/)... just because.
 - Making the example async would be interesting (might do that tomorrow). Also thinking about looking into actual unit testing (f# interactive is great for proof of concept and prototyping... which is also why I'm using fsharp script files instead of fsharp code files with proper modules/namespaces etc.).

**Examples**:

### Day 4: January 5, 2018

**Today's Focus**: Continue learning [FSharp.Data](http://fsharp.github.io/FSharp.Data/) library. Also look into async programming in F#.

**Details**:

 - Explored the [async workflow](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/language-reference/asynchronous-workflows) in F#.
 - There are two ways to use Async, via an *asyc { ... }* block or using *Async.Methods*. I opted for the latter this time around.
 - Updated the [JSON Type Provider](http://fsharp.github.io/FSharp.Data/library/JsonProvider.html) (using the free [IEX Trading API](https://iextrading.com/developer/docs/#getting-started) to grab a bunch of tech giant stock quote information and display the current trading price) to load each stock quote asynchronously and then display them all at the end. I could try displaying them as they come back, but then I couldn't sort them by price descending.
 - I also discovered the *#time* timer in F# interactive. I used it to compare the sync vs async versions of my code. I looped the stock quotes 10 times (twice for each type) and it was consistently faster with the async version.
 - Lost internet for about two hours last night :angry:

**Examples**: This animated GIF shows comparing the two approaches:

### Day 5: January 6, 2018 

**Today's Focus**: Begin learning [FSharp.Charting](https://fslab.org/FSharp.Charting/index.html) and combine it with [FSharp.Data](http://fsharp.github.io/FSharp.Data/) library. 

**Details**:

 - Used the [HTML Type Provider](http://fsharp.github.io/FSharp.Data/library/HtmlProvider.html) to scrape Wikipedia for [PGA Tour Major winners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_men%27s_major_championships_winning_golfers#By_golfer)  (Name, total wins and winning span (first to last major win year)).
 - Used the [FSharp.Charting Bar Chart](https://fslab.org/FSharp.Charting/BarAndColumnCharts.html) to display total major wins (you pass in the minimum wins to be included to keep the number of golfers down so the chart doesn't have way too many people on one axis). *NOTE: The bar chart documentation was a bit messed up, so it took some playing around to figure things out.*
 - ***Abused*** the [FSharp.Charting.BoxPlot Chart](https://fslab.org/FSharp.Charting/BoxPlotCharts.html) which is normally used for statistics (six statistics with lower whisker, upper whisker, lower box, upper box, average and median). I just like that it looked like a range chart, so manipulated the golfer major winning span years to work with the chart. It worked out pretty well!

**Examples**: Here are the two charts in action:

![Day 5 Example - Total Wins](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jasondown/100-days-of-code/master/images/day5_total_wins.png)

### Day 6: January 7, 2018 

**Today's Focus**: Continue learning [FSharp.Charting](https://fslab.org/FSharp.Charting/index.html) and refactoring the golf major championship charting code.

**Details**:

 - Discovered the [FSharp.Charting.RangeColumn](https://fslab.org/FSharp.Charting/reference/fsharp-charting-chart.html) (and Range) chart. I had to find it in the main API page since they didn't have a link and example to it like some of the other chart types.
 - Updated the golf major championship winners script to use the RangeColumn chart, which simplified the code  over the original BoxPlot chart I used yesterday.
 - Refactored the code to more easily adjust the parameters and charts dynamically. 
 - Discovered you can use stuff like Label = ["#VALY, #VALY2"](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd456687.aspx) to label values based on the data for each record. Unfortunately you can't do expressions on them (like "#VALY2" - "#VALY" to get the total years between the end and beginning date).

**Examples**: Here are the updated charts:

![Day 6 Example - Total Wins](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jasondown/100-days-of-code/master/images/day6_total_wins.png)

### Day 7: January 8, 2018

**Today's Focus**: I joined the F# open source community tonight via the [FsProjects/Mechanic](https://github.com/fsprojects/Mechanic) project on GitHub. 

This project is aimed at getting some new comers to the F# OSS community with mentoring and guidance from some very talented developers like [Steffen Forkmann](https://github.com/forki) (creator of [Paket](https://fsprojects.github.io/Paket/)) and [Krzysztof Cieślak](https://github.com/Krzysztof-Cieslak) (creator of the [Ionide](http://ionide.io/) plugin for f# cross-platform development in Visual Studio Code).

**Details**: I'll be learning the following tool chain to go along with F#:

 - [Paket](https://fsprojects.github.io/Paket/index.html) - Dependency management.
 - [Fake](https://fake.build/) (F# Make) - An F# DSL for build tasks and more.
 - [DotNet CLI](https://github.com/dotnet/cli/) - Command line tools for .Net Core.
 - [GitVersion](https://github.com/GitTools/GitVersion) - Easy semantic versioning for projects using GitHub.
 - [FsCheck](https://fscheck.github.io/FsCheck/) - Property based testing (based on Haskell Quickcheck).
 - [Expecto](https://github.com/haf/expecto) - A testing library for F#.

I spent most of my time on getting the repository forked and built and then exploring the project. I even made my first pull request, which was accepted. **Woo!** It was just fixing a link in the readme, but you gotta start somewhere.

### Day 8: January 9, 2018

**Today's Focus**: Returned to learning [FSharp.Charting](https://fslab.org/FSharp.Charting/index.html) and [FSharp.Data](http://fsharp.github.io/FSharp.Data/) libraries.

 **Details**:
 
 - Explored the [World Bank Type provider](http://fsharp.github.io/FSharp.Data/library/WorldBank.html):
	 >The World Bank is an international organization that provides financial and technical assistance to developing countries around the world. As one of the activities, the World Bank also collects development indicators and other data about countries in the world. The data catalog contains over 8,000 indicators that can be programmatically accessed.
 - *NOTE: There are a lot of indicators, so the Intellisense can take a couple seconds to pop up initially.*
 - Used the async version of the type provider to load multiple indicators for multiple countries at once.
 - Used FSharp.Charting again to draw some interesting charts for displaying the data.
 - Used the new .Net underscore separator so large integer constants are easier to read:
	 -  *50_000_000 vs 50000000 is much easier to tell you are talking about 50 million.*

**Examples**: The final result of playing around was to load the total population, female population and male population of Canada, the US and the UK and display them in comparison charts. Not too shabby for relatively little code.

### Day 9: January 10, 2018

**Today's Focus**: [Analyzing and Visualizing Data With F#](https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/analyzing-and-visualizing-data-with-f-sharp) (book by Tomas Petricek). The first chapter was a nice mix of stuff I've already been playing with and new stuff.

 **Details**: The following technologies were used:

 - [OpenWeatherMap API](https://www.openweathermap.org/api) (I already had an api key when I was reading [Elixir and OTP](https://www.manning.com/books/the-little-elixir-and-otp-guidebook) a while ago. Who knew!?!)
 - [FsLab](https://fslab.org/)
 - [World Bank Type Provider](http://fsharp.github.io/FSharp.Data/library/WorldBank.html)
 - [Google GeoChart](https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/gallery/geochart)

The idea was to:

 - Use the World Bank type provider to get a list of capital cities in the world.
 - Take that list and feed it into a chain of calls to the OpenWeatherMap API to get the high temperature for tomorrow's forecast (in degrees Celsius).
 - I had to work some F# magic to handle capital cities that weren't listed in the OpenWeatherMap API for some reason (e.g. Washington D.C. ... strange).
 - Feed the list of cities into the Google GeoChart and configure it for some pretty colours to show the temperature.

*Caveat: The temperature for an entire country is based on the temperature in the capital city. Obviously, that is not very accurate. At this time of night, what are you gonna do?* 

Unfortunately, if a city didn't come back with a temperature, the temperature was not set and that country is greyed out. Oh well.

### Day 10: January 11, 2018

**Today's Focus**:  Continued with the book [Analyzing and Visualizing Data With F#](https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/analyzing-and-visualizing-data-with-f-sharp) by Tomas Petricek. The second chapter introduced some new stuff from [FsLab](https://fslab.org/).

 **Details**:

 - Began looking at the [Deedle](http://bluemountaincapital.github.io/Deedle/) exploratory library.
	 >Deedle is an easy to use library for data and time series manipulation and for scientific programming. It supports working with structured data frames, ordered and unordered data, as well as time series. Deedle is designed to work well for exploratory programming using F# and C# interactive console, but can be also used in efficient compiled .NET code.
 - I combined Deedle with the World Bank API again (this time accessed through the [XML Type Provider](http://fsharp.github.io/FSharp.Data/library/XmlProvider.html) rather than the [World Bank Type Provider](http://fsharp.github.io/FSharp.Data/library/WorldBank.html)).
 - Looked up various indicators for all countries, for specific years or date ranges.
 - Showed data in a [Google GeoChart](https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/gallery/geochart).
 - Showed data in a Deedle Frame (think table displayed in F# Interactive).

I stopped about 3/4 of the way through chapter 2 before getting into the R Type Provider (requires installing R, but gives you access to R charts/plots, statistics etc. directly in F#).

**Examples**: Nothing too fancy to show tonight in a gif (couple more geo charts, which I won't show). This is an example of a section of a Deedle Frame showing a bunch of indicators from the World Bank for 2012 (lots of values start to be missing as you get more recent for some of these things). With R and the R Type provider, I could plot some cool diagrams and find possible correlations between indicators. One day...

### Day 11: January 12, 2018

**Today's Focus**:  Web programming in F# using the [Suave](https://suave.io/) framework.

 **Details**:

 - Exploring [Sauve](https://suave.io)
	 >Suave is a simple web development F# library providing a lightweight web server and a set of combinators to manipulate route flow and task composition.
 - Started with GET and POST implementations for people (I guess similar to a controller, but less bloat).
 - I'll admit, at first the syntax was weird, even for F#. Then I realized that they just built a little DSL to easily compose things together (combinators) via a **>=>** operator. It looks even crazier with my FiraCode font and ligatures:

![Day 11 - Ligatures](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jasondown/100-days-of-code/master/images/day11_ligatures.jpg)

I've been following along with [this tutorial](http://blog.tamizhvendan.in/blog/2015/06/11/building-rest-api-in-fsharp-using-suave/) (some slight mods have to be made because the library has been changed slightly since the tutorial was written).

**Examples**: Here are some Postman screenshots of the POST and GET requests:

![Day 11 Example - POST](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jasondown/100-days-of-code/master/images/day11_postsuave.png)

### Day 12: January 13, 2018

**Today's Focus**:  Continued web programming in F# via the [Suave](https://suave.io/) framework.

 **Details**:
 
 - Moved forward with the [tutorial](http://blog.tamizhvendan.in/blog/2015/06/11/building-rest-api-in-fsharp-using-suave/) from yesterday. Today it clicked completely after seeing more of the code, which just made it that much cooler to me.
 - Added the HTTP PUT (with some error handling for missing resources) and HTTP DELETE implementations (again, both implemenations are for people in a "database" (read: in memory Dictionary)).

**Examples**: Postman screenshots below.

HTTP GET - Just to show the dataset that was created via HTTP POST:

![Day 12 Example - HTTP GET](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jasondown/100-days-of-code/master/images/day12_getsuave.png)

HTTP PUT - To change Yoda's name:

![Day 12 Example - HTTP PUT](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jasondown/100-days-of-code/master/images/day12_putsuave.png)

HTTP PUT - Error handling for missing resources. *This is not the captain you're looking for*:

![Day 12 Example - HTTP PUT With Error Handling](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jasondown/100-days-of-code/master/images/day12_put_no_resource_suave.png)

HTTP DELETE - Not much to see here, other than the 204 status (people/3 was Darth Vader, who was [erased from existence](https://youtu.be/WAQbRFZU7rE?t=12s)):

### Day 13: January 14, 2018

**Today's Focus**:  As I learn new things ([Suave](https://suave.io) framework), I like to combine the *new hotness* with recent things I learned to make sure I cement those ideas into my noggin... Ok, that word immediately brings some [flash backs](https://youtu.be/t-OCjvbV2Z4?t=8s). 

![It's Like an Orange on a Toothpick](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jasondown/100-days-of-code/master/images/day13.gif)

 **Details**:

 - Today I continued working with the [Suave](https://suave.io/) framework to finish [this tutorial](http://blog.tamizhvendan.in/blog/2015/06/11/building-rest-api-in-fsharp-using-suave/). There were a few new commands added making use of HTTP HEAD etc. to see if a record exists.
 - Taking some motivation from the React sessions put on a couple coworkers about 6 months ago, I used the [Star Wars API](https://swapi.co/) (SWAPI) to populate my "database" (dictionary) on start up with characters from Star Wars. 
 - I explored the code from Evelina Gabasova's [F# Swapi](https://github.com/evelinag/fsharp-swapi) library to nicely integrate the Star Wars API into the code via the [F# JSON Type Provider](http://fsharp.github.io/FSharp.Data/library/JsonProvider.html).
 - I also modified the original tutorial code a bit to better fit the data types returned by the SWAPI.
 - Lastly, I did some refactoring of the original tutorial code.

**Examples**: Here is Postman in action, loading all the SW characters and a single one:

### Day 14: January 15, 2018

**Today's Focus**: Tonight I decided to do some [Codingame](https://codingame.com/) puzzles.

**Details**:

 - I created a new repository to hold my solutions (for anything except for contests, since they don't like you to do that).
 - I tossed up all my *Classic Puzzle - Easy* solutions for C# and F#. A couple things I noticed:
	 - I realized I hadn't solved all of them in both languages. I'll be doing that soon.
	 - My C# code from some of the older solutions I did a couple of years ago look a little different from how I'd do them today.
 - I also tossed up one of my *code golf* solutions (F#... which will beat C# for size, but no chance against the python solutions).
 - Finally, I started looking into one of the *optimization* challenges (Code vs Zombies). That's just a shell right now with the default code for the F# solution.

Plans for the rest of the week:
 - Finish the four *Classic Puzzle - Easy* challenges I missed (2 for F# and 2 for C#... not the same ones mind you).
 - Get some more *code golf* challenges up (probably just F#).
 - Finish my Code vs Zombies solution.
 - Time permitting, I'll do some more optimization puzzles.
 - If I'm feeling really ambitious, I'll start going at the *Classic Puzzle - Medium* challenges (I have a couple done already in both C# and F#).
 - In the distant future (before my 100 days are up), I'll do some of the puzzles in another language or two (leaning towards Scala first).

Also, after 2 weeks, here is how my github contributions are looking. Unfortunately, on the first day and the fourth day I made all my commits just after midnight, so they look like they were part of day 2 and day 5. Mind the gap!

### Day 15: January 16, 2018

**Today's Focus**: Continued with some [Codingame](https://codingame.com/) puzzles.

**Details**:

 - Decided to do three *Classic Puzzle - Easy* solutions in Scala. It was similar enough to F# for me to get the gist of it, but different enough that I had to do some research.
 - I don't know much about the JVM (haven't programmed in Java in over 15 years!), but Scala seems pretty cool.
 - I may need to explore Clojure a little more now too (I hear there is a Clojure for the .Net CLR too). I do like me some LISP.

As an added bonus the past couple of days, I have been creating this log on GitHub. I'm finally caught up today (my logs were being created on an internal platform where I work before I discovered this repository and forked it).

Also, I was listening to this cool [Scandroid](https://scandroid.bandcamp.com/album/scandroid) (Cyberpunk genre) album tonight while working. I recommend it!

### Day 16: January 17, 2018

**Today's Focus**: Continued with some [Codingame](https://codingame.com/) puzzles.

**Details**:

- Added two *Classic Puzzle - Medium* solutions in F#: War (the card game) and Don't Panic ([HHGTTG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy) reference)
- The solutions are very domain logic centric (overkill for these solutions, but something that's more enterprisey like).
- I attempted a third puzzle (trying to be overly clever). Failed miserably. I'll make another attempt at it tomorrow, likely without trying to be *clever*.

### Day 17: January 18, 2018

**Today's Focus**: 100 Days of code is now merging with some work related interests. I've decided to update the TidyHtml5Managed wrapper library around Tidy (or HTML Tidy... or HTML Tidy 5) to the newest version and update the nuget package. I'd also like to make sure the XML documentation is part of the NuGet package.

**Details**

- Original managed library was created by Mark Beaton [here](https://github.com/markbeaton/TidyManaged).
- Updates were made by Frandi Dwi to drop support for the old version of Tidy and support version 5.0. [here](https://github.com/frandi/TidyHtml5Managed). Support for versions of .Net from 2.0 through 4.5 were also added.
- More updates were made by gabrieleteotino to support 32 bit and 64 bit versions [here](https://github.com/gabrieleteotino/TidyHtml5Managed). The supported version of Tidy was also updated to 5.2.
- Original Tidy library (C version) was found [here](http://tidy.sourceforge.net/).
- New versions of Tidy (C version) are now maintained [here](http://www.html-tidy.org/) (and source code is [here](https://github.com/htacg/tidy-html5)).
- I've forked the managed repository (seems to no longer be maintained) and fixed some links. I plan to update to the latest version of Tidy (5.6 at the moment) and add the necessary PInvoke calls for any new features.
- I also plan to create an updated NuGet package and ensure that the XML documentation is included (currently this is not the case in [this](https://www.nuget.org/packages/TidyHtml5ManagedRepack/) package or [this](https://www.nuget.org/packages/TidyHtml5Managed/) package).

### Day 19: January 20, 2018

**Today's Focus**: Looking for some APIs to play with so made use of [FSharp.Data](http://fsharp.github.io/FSharp.Data/) library for discovery.

**Details**:

 - Used the [JSON Type Provider](http://fsharp.github.io/FSharp.Data/library/JsonProvider.html) to get a list of Google APIs.
 - Converted the JSON responses to summary objects with title, version, description and documenation links.
 - Converted the summaries into an HTML file with a table (rather ugly, but I was not going for a nice design).

**Examples**: This is a screen shot of my fugly html file:

### Day 20: January 21, 2018

**Today's Focus**: Double whammy today. Continued with some [Codingame](https://codingame.com/) puzzles. Also helped a friend's son work through some issues on a final project in Java (it's been 15 years since I wrote Java!). It felt great to help someone taking their first programming class.

**Details**:

- Added a *code golf* solution in F#: Don't Panic.
- Added a *code golf* solution in F#: Temperatures.
- Worked through some JPanel paintComponent override issues in some very complicated code for a Blackjack game. Complicated as in a beginner's code that uses many nested if statements and global variables to manage state and flow, all inside of the paint functionality. He still did a good job, but it was interesting to see code written in a way I probably would have done 15 years ago. It really makes me appreciate functional programming with pure functions and the lack of needing to keep track of tons of global state.

**Examples**: On that note, here is some really ugly F# I wrote in the name of code golf. Seems fitting for today.

### Day 21: January 22, 2018

**Today's Focus**: Decided to play around with some machine learning. I've had a copy of Mathias Brandewinder's book [Machine Learning Projects for .Net Developers](https://www.apress.com/us/book/9781430267676) for a while and finally started to dig in tonight.

**Details**:

- Read chapter 1 tonight: 256 Shades of Gray.
	- The chapter gives you a short introduction into machine learning basics.
	- It then tackles a classic machine learning problem: **classifying images**. In particular, building a digit recognizer (borrowed from the [Kaggle.com](http://www.kaggle.com) machine learning competition found [here](http://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer)).
- Interesting fun fact from the book:
	>CAPTCHA (“Completely Automated Public Turing Test to tell Computers and Humans Apart”) is a
mechanism devised to filter out computer bots from humans. To make sure a user is an actual
human being, CAPTCHA displays a piece of text purposefully obfuscated to make automatic computer
recognition difficult. In an intriguing twist, the idea has been extended with reCAPTCHA. reCAPTCHA
displays two images instead of just one: one of them is used to filter out bots, while the other is an
actual digitized piece of text (see figure 1-1). Every time a human logs in that way, he also helps digitize
archive documents, such as back issues of the New York Times, one word at a time.
- The book goes through code samples in both C# and F#, comparing the two.
- I spent tonight setting up the repository and reading the first chapter. Tomorrow I will re-read it while coding the examples as I follow along.

**Details**:

- Continued with chapter 1: 256 Shades of Gray.
- Project is to create a classifier (digit recognizer).
- Added Evaluator class in C# solution and updated the console application to evaluate the algorithm. **93.40% accuracy!**
- Added an F# project to the solution.
- Implemented an F# script (less than 50 lines of code) to replace the equivalent C# code for Observation, DataReader, IDistance, ManhattanDistance, IClassifier, BasicClassifier and Evaluator.
- Used F# Interactive to replace the console application.
- Also updated this log's table of contents to be in tabular format.

**Today's Focus**: Continued with machine learning with Mathias Brandewinder's book [Machine Learning Projects for .Net Developers](https://www.apress.com/us/book/9781430267676).

**Details**:

- Took the day off work sick (tossed my cookies around 4:30 am).
- Finished chapter 1: 256 Shades of Gray.
- Project is to create a classifier (digit recognizer).
- Refactored F# solution to accept different distance functions.
- Created a Euclidean distance function which improved the evaluator to **94.40% accuracy!**
- Created a C# functional style classifier to accept a Func<int[], int[], int> delegate for the distance function.
- The book didn't hook up this new C# functional classifier, so I had to figure that out myself. I feel it was only halfway to functional style programming. More could be done, but I'd like to move on to chapter 2.
- Used the new C#7 local function feature instead of a Func delegate with the new classifier.

**Details**:

- Another sick day for work. Feeling better tonight though.
- Got 2/3rds of the way through chapter 2: Ham or Spam.
- Project is to create a spam filter.
- Using an [SMS Spam Collection](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/SMS+Spam+Collection) dataset from UCI machine learning repository.
- Loaded the dataset and tested a primitive classifier.
- Created a Naive Bayes Classifier.
- Modified some of the code samples to use new F# 4.x features.
- Tomorrow I'll be creating tokenizers to test the classifier.

- Created basic classifier that made use of the word tokenizer (very simple one).
- Trained the classifier (book forgot to put that code in).
- Cross validation with the classifier for **87.7% accuracy**. This is less impressive considering choosing ham over spam every time will result in nearly 85% accuracy.
- Tomorrow will include an improved classifier.

**Details**:

- Got through most of one more section of chapter 2: Ham or Spam.
- Project is to create a spam filter.
- Using an [SMS Spam Collection](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/SMS+Spam+Collection) dataset from UCI machine learning repository.
- Created a case sensitive word tokenizer.
- Did some refactoring and strayed slightly from the book, but this allowed me to easily compare classifiers.
- Created, trained and compared the following classifiers (accuracy percentage):
	- Baseline, always choose ham (higher percentage of sms messages are ham): **84.8%**
	- If contains "txt" (cit*) then spam else ham: **87.7%**
	- Use all words (cit*) and compare vs training data: **86.4%**
	- Use all words (cst*) and compare vs training data: **87.5%**
	- Use top 10% ham+spam tokens (cst*) and compare vs training data: **95.2%**
	- Use top 10% ham+spam tokens, remove common to both (cst*) and compare vs training data: **97.9%**
	- ***cit = case insensitive tokenizer***
	- ***cst = case sensitive tokenizer***
- Still a few improvements to make before chapter 2 is done (tomorrow).

### Day 29: January 30, 2018

**Today's Focus**: Continued with machine learning with Mathias Brandewinder's book [Machine Learning Projects for .Net Developers](https://www.apress.com/us/book/9781430267676).

**Details**:

- Read through chapter 3, but skipped the code examples. It was an introduction to FSharp.Data, FSharp.Charting, Deedle and the R Type Provider. These are things I already explored earlier in my 100 days of code.
- Began chapter 4: Of Bikes and Men.
- Project is to create a prediction model (regression model) using methods such as gradient descent and linear algebra.
- Using a [Bike Sharing](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset) dataset from UCI machine learning repository.
- Ran into some issues trying to create the F# library project. It turned out that when I updated Visual Studio yesterday I forgot to include the F# desktop development tools (I only had F# .Net Core and .Net Standard, but not .Net Framework). This was wreaking havoc with the FSharp.Data nuget package. All fixed up now.
- Used the [CSV Type provider](http://fsharp.github.io/FSharp.Data/library/CsvProvider.html) to load the bike sharing dataset.
- Did some basic charting via [FSharp.Charting ](https://fslab.org/FSharp.Charting/) to explore the data and look for some basic trends.
- Compared bike usage counts over time vs a moving average for 7 days and 30 days (again, exploring trends). 
- Displayed the comparison in a combined chart.

**Examples**: Here is the combined chart. I added a little more detail than the book (legend, colours and axis labels), but this is just to do some quick exploring before getting into gradient descent etc.

### Day 30: January 31, 2018

**Today's Focus**: Continued with machine learning with Mathias Brandewinder's book [Machine Learning Projects for .Net Developers](https://www.apress.com/us/book/9781430267676).

**Details**:

- Continued a few sections in chapter 4: Of Bikes and Men.
- Project is to create a prediction model (regression model) using methods such as gradient descent and linear algebra.
- Using a [Bike Sharing](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset) dataset from UCI machine learning repository.
- Looked at finding straight-line models and lowest cost models.
- Read up on derivatives for a refresher (it has been 20 years since I used Calculus!).
- Explored Gradient Descent.
	- The idea makes sense (the author does a great job at explaining the concept in plain English).
	- The math makes sense for the most part (the gist of what it is doing).
	- The formulas written in the math-notation are a bit of a head spinner for me (don't read it often).
	- Implemented a stochastic gradient descent.
	- Implemented a batch gradient descent.
	- Explored error evaluations for both models.
- Created some graphs to visually explore the concepts.
- Tomorrow is ***Linear Algebra to the Rescue!*** Hopefully the small refresher provided is enough!

**Examples**: Here are a few of the charts that I created.

Linear Combination (I think haha!):

### Day 31: February 1, 2018

**Today's Focus**: Continued with machine learning with Mathias Brandewinder's book [Machine Learning Projects for .Net Developers](https://www.apress.com/us/book/9781430267676).

**Details**:

- Continued a few sections in chapter 4: Of Bikes and Men.
- Project is to create a prediction model (regression model) using methods such as gradient descent and linear algebra.
- Using a [Bike Sharing](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset) dataset from UCI machine learning repository.
- Refresher on Linear Algebra, vectors and matrices.
- Explored the MathNet library (lets you work with vectors and matrices very easily in the code).
- Replaced original code from past few days with linear algebra style code. Although, not a complete conversion because we can take advantage of **normal form regression** instead of gradient descent for this particular problem.
- Took advantage of the **Math Kernel Library (MKL)** that uses highly-optimized math libraries that are built within Intel processors.	
- Created more cross-validation logic, simplified model creation functions and the ability to easily add features to models.
- Created some graphs to visually explore the model differences of 1 feature vs 5 features (line chart and scatter plot).

**Examples**: Here are a few of the charts that I created.

Linear Algebra with MathNet library. Looks very close to how you would write vectors and matrices by hand:  
![Day 31 Example - Linear Algebra with MathNet Library](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jasondown/100-days-of-code/master/images/day31_linear_algebra.png)

Linear Algebra with Normal Form Regression, comparing models (predictions) with actual (line chart).  
Single feature model is not bad, but five feature model is much closer to the actual data:  
![Day 31 Example - Model Comparison Line Chart](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jasondown/100-days-of-code/master/images/day31_linear_algebra_feature_comparison.png)

Linear Algebra with Normal Form Regression, comparing models (predictions) with actual (scatter plot).  
Single feature model is definitely not on a nice slope of 1 (or 45 degree angle). The five feature model is pretty close:

### Day 32: February 2, 2018

**Today's Focus**: Continued with machine learning with Mathias Brandewinder's book [Machine Learning Projects for .Net Developers](https://www.apress.com/us/book/9781430267676).

**Details**:

- Finished chapter 4: Of Bikes and Men.
- Project is to create a prediction model (regression model) using methods such as gradient descent and linear algebra.
- Using a [Bike Sharing](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset) dataset from UCI machine learning repository.
- Explored categorical features and dealing with collinearity issues.
- Compared linear functions with higher-order polynomial functions.
- In particular, looked at using a polynomial function to handle bike usage based on temperature. As the temperature warms up, bike usage goes up. However, it levels off and starts coming down again when the temperature gets too hot. The curved line of a polynomial more correctly relates to the data.
- Also looked at regularization and normalization.
- Created some more graphs to visually explore the models.

**Examples**: Here is a chart showing the temperature example:

- Explored collaborative filtering to make a primitive recommendation system.
- Recommender system was 32% accurate in recommending a stackoverflow tag to a user (predict vs. actual).
- Baseline comparison of recommending the top tag to a user was only 13% accurate, so not too bad an improvement.

- Explored Decision Stumps (single features) to look at various features and build classifiers to predict if a person survived or died in the Titanic disaster.
- Classifiers ranged from passenger class, passenger sex, port of origin etc.
- Handled missing data (e.g. port of origin was not required).
- Handled continuous numeric values (ticket fares) by taking the large number of different values and applying discretization (group them into cheap tickets and expensive tickets) to get better information for a classifier.

**Today's Focus**: Continued with machine learning with Mathias Brandewinder's book [Machine Learning Projects for .Net Developers](https://www.apress.com/us/book/9781430267676).

**Details**:

- Did another section in chapter 6: Trees and Forests
- Project takes a look at a dataset regarding Titanic passengers, based on [this](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) machine learning competition.
- Used the [CSV Type Provider](http://fsharp.github.io/FSharp.Data/library/CsvProvider.html) to load the data and get compile time safety and Intellisense.
- Looked into using [(Shannon) Entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(information_theory)) to figure out what features would give you the biggest information gain (think 20 questions and narrowing down your choices quicker by asking questions like "Is it alive?" first).
- Used entropy to better choose a value for [discretization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discretization_of_continuous_features) (e.g. Age is best split at 7 years old, assuming 2 groups is best).
	- NOTE: Need to read up on [Minimum Description Length](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_description_length) to explore using more than 2 groups for discretization.
- Explored information gain by a feature, then further splitting into sub-groups. Splitting by sex, then class yields the best results for this particular dataset.

- Created a new script to try the tree out, with 80% accuracy.
- Output of tree is uuuuuuugly though.

**Today's Focus**: Continued with machine learning with Mathias Brandewinder's book [Machine Learning Projects for .Net Developers](https://www.apress.com/us/book/9781430267676).

**Details**:

- Completed chapter 6: Trees and Forests
- Project takes a look at a dataset regarding Titanic passengers, based on [this](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) machine learning competition.
- Used the [CSV Type Provider](http://fsharp.github.io/FSharp.Data/library/CsvProvider.html) to load the data and get compile time safety and Intellisense.
- Looked into deeper cross-validation via [K-Folds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-validation_(statistics)#k-fold_cross-validation) to create multiple combinations of training and validation samples to generate a range of values describing the quality of the model.
- Implemented a [Random Forest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest) (an [ensemble learning method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ensemble_learning)) used to train main decision trees with randomly selected combinations of features, training data and validation data.
	- While each tree is slightly less accurate than one using the entire dataset, it prevents over-fitting to that specific data and creating a model that is not necessarily as good as it seems. The forest allows a combination and majority vote between the many trees that is usually more accurate for real classification/prediction.

### Day 42: February 12, 2018

**Today's Focus**: In honour of the number 42 (day 42), I decided to do a [HHGTTG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy) nod by returning to [Codingame](https://www.codingame.com) and work on [Don't Panic - Episode 2](https://www.codingame.com/training/hard/don't-panic-episode-2).

**Details**:

- This puzzle is my first attempt a *Classic Puzzle - Hard* category.
- I've got 5 of the 10 test cases passing. [Here](https://www.codingame.com/replay/solo/287776216) is a sample of one of the passing tests.
- I used my episode 1 code (as suggested by the instructional text), with some tweaks for the new rules. These are good until best path restrictions are added (for the remaining unpassing tests).
- I'll need to look into an appropriate shortest path algorithm, such as [BFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search), [A*](http://web.mit.edu/eranki/www/tutorials/search/), [Alpha-beta pruning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha%E2%80%93beta_pruning) or perhaps [Dijkstra's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm). 
- I've implemented some of these in C# before, using a Graphs (for Codingame challenges, actually) but never in F#.
- Looking forward to finishing this off tomorrow before returning to Machine Learning.

**Today's Focus**: Continued [Codingame](https://www.codingame.com) and work on [Don't Panic - Episode 2](https://www.codingame.com/training/hard/don't-panic-episode-2).

**Details**:

- This puzzle is my first attempt a *Classic Puzzle - Hard* category.
- I've got another test case working for best path (6/10 passing now).
- Read lots of material on shortest path algorithm, such as [BFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search), [A*](http://web.mit.edu/eranki/www/tutorials/search/), [Alpha-beta pruning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha%E2%80%93beta_pruning) or perhaps [Dijkstra's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm). 
- It's tough to find examples of these algorithms in F# (I may have to look into something like Haskell... or just do an imperative style like I've done in C#).
- I also need to look at the cost/weight calculation because just distance to the closest elevator is not enough. You also have to take into account the cost of building missing elevators (and how many you have left), the cost of blocking clones (and number of clones left) and sometimes, look ahead to another level (the exit is sometimes surrounded by elevators that lead to a no-exit scenario).

- Moved up to Silver League (before Gold has been unlocked, yay!).
- Moved into ~150 overall for a time, but sitting around ~220 now. Still happy with this at the moment (highest finish ever was 256th).
- Back to 1st overall in F#
- There are about 400 people in the newly unlocked Silver League. Need to really step up my game tomorrow and start adding MoveAttack rather than AttackNearest.

### Day 66: March 8, 2018

**Today's Focus**: Codingame Contest (Day 7)

**Details**:

- Continued the Botters of the Galaxy contest.
- Tweaked some distances for MoveAttack... again.
- If Groot is attacking me, fight him instead of running away. He's easy to kill and gives you lots of gold.
- Was getting some random timeouts, that eventually went away when I got rid of all my debug messages to the error console (used mostly to trace which path my code took each turn for each hero).
- Completely removed my low health strategy code (well didn't remove it, but removed the pattern match path to it). This ended up making a big difference in a good way.
- Stayed in Silver league, but hovered around 5th (~295th overall).

**Details**:

- Continued the Botters of the Galaxy contest.
- Moved into Gold league about 1 hour before Legend league was unlocked. Yaaaaaaaaas!
- Very little time to code other than minor tweaks (even forgot to commit and broke my 100 days of code streak at 61 (day 5 I did the same).
- Was ~235 in gold (255 overall). NOTE: My best finish ever is 256th overall (made Gold league).
- Ended day closer to 260 in Gold.

### Day 68: March 10, 2018

**Today's Focus**: Codingame Contest (Day 9)

**Details**:

- Continued the Botters of the Galaxy contest.
- Discovered there was a dual Hulk bug (you could choose Hulk and wait on your second pick to autopick...Hulk!).
	- People took advantage of this by storming the enemy heroes with the 2 Hulks (highest damage and health).
	- This was enough to get past the gold boss.
	- By the time I found out, most people had coded to protect against this.
	- I found I had dropped all the way to approx ~520th overall (~485th in gold)!
- Tried the Hulk strategy, but it was too late to be effective. Moved to ~500th overall.

### Day 69: March 11, 2018

**Today's Focus**: Codingame Contest (Day 10)

**Details**:

- Final day of the Botters of the Galaxy contest (it ended the next day: Monday at 5 am, but Sunday night was the end for me).
- Finally decided to do the Ironman + Dr. Strange approach. This was the most popular.
- It was enough to move up a little more, but too many people had tweaked this over the week for me to find anything new.
- Started to notice lots of people using the Groot strategy I had been using since day 2.
- Discovered a sniper strategy for Ironman hiding in a bush near the enemy tower:
	- Hide in a bush just out of range (had to just be in the edge to be close enough...took some math for that one).
	- Jump out of bush, move towards tower and attack.
	- Blink skill back to bush to move fast enough from being hit from Tower attack.
	- This moved me up a bit more in the rankings. However, not all maps had a bush in the right range.
	- Changed to check for such a bush. If found, do Ironman + Valkyrie (she was more effective at staying alive along than Dr. Strange while Ironman sniped and slowly took the enemy tower down).
	- If no bush found, revert to Ironman + Dr. Strange and play conservative (aggressive seemed less effective).
- **Finished 296th in Gold, 416th overall (out of 1713) and 2nd in F#.**

### Day 80: March 22, 2018

**Today's Focus**: The [Botters of the Galaxy](https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/botters-of-the-galaxy) multiplayer arena game was released on Codingame.

**Details**:

 - The multiplayer version of the recent BOTG contest was released. It has 6 wood leagues now so that it can start even more basic (one hero, no units, no groots) and add extra elements at a slower pace. Also, any bugs found in the contest after the single bug patch were addressed. No more dual Hulks to worry about.
 - Wood 6 was actually difficult to get past because everyone had the same strategy: Hang back by your tower and attack the enemy hero only when they are in range to take damage from the tower. This results in a lot of tie games that don't move players up or down the ranking ladder.
 - I managed to finally sneak by wood 6 and then spent the next two hours moving through all the wood leagues and into Bronze league.
 	- Added logic for units.
	- Added logic for safe distances (don't go to close to enemy tower, taking into account my hero movement speed and attack target etc.).
	- Added logic for moving and attacking in parallel.
	- Added logic for controlling 2 heroes.
	- Added some messaging logic.
- The Silver league is not opened for 6 more days, so I stopped there (didn't code any Bronze logic that was unlocked).

### Day 92: April 4, 2018

**Today's Focus**: Began two Pluralsight courses: [Creating Web Applications With Go](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/creating-web-applications-go-update/table-of-contents) and [Clean Architecture: Patterns, Practices and Principles](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/clean-architecture-patterns-practices-principles/table-of-contents).

**Details**:
	
 - Creating Web Applications With Go
 	- Created a very small Hello World style web application in Go.
 	- Reviewed MVC pattern for use in Go web programming application.
 
 - Clean Architecture: Patterns, Practices and Principles
 	- Began learning about domain-centric archictecture, following along a sample C# application (didn't do any coding myself).
	- Basic overview of onion architecture, hexagonal architecture, BCE architecture and clean architecture (also known as screaming architecture).
	- Compared the above architectures with traditional three-layer database-centric architecture.

### Day 93: April 5, 2018

**Today's Focus**: Continued two Pluralsight courses: [Creating Web Applications With Go](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/creating-web-applications-go-update/table-of-contents) and [Clean Architecture: Patterns, Practices and Principles](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/clean-architecture-patterns-practices-principles/table-of-contents).

**Details**:
	
 - Creating Web Applications With Go
 	- Imported a demo application (with massive amounts of Node package dependencies) as a starting point.
 	- Initial application is serving up static web pages and css.
 	- Added basic HTTP request handling, first with a struct and then using handlefunc.
	
 - Clean Architecture: Patterns, Practices and Principles
 	- Began learning about the application layer (and the differences between it and the domain layer).
	- Looked at inversion of control, dependency inversion principle, dependency injection etc.
	- Explored using interfaces to be implemented by the outer layers of the architecture (of which the application layer has no knowledge).
	- Again, C# example application was used, but I was only following along without coding for this one.

### Day 94: April 6, 2018

**Today's Focus**: Continued two Pluralsight courses: [Creating Web Applications With Go](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/creating-web-applications-go-update/table-of-contents) and [Clean Architecture: Patterns, Practices and Principles](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/clean-architecture-patterns-practices-principles/table-of-contents).

**Details**:
	
 - Creating Web Applications With Go
 	- Looked at creating custom file server using http.HandleFunc.
	
 - Clean Architecture: Patterns, Practices and Principles
 	- Looked at Command-Query Separation and pros/cons.
		- Single-database CQRS
			- Commands use domain.
			- Queries use database.
		- Two-database CQRS
			- Read and write databases.
			- Commands use write db.
			- Queries use read db.
			- Eventual consistency (lag between the two).
			- Huge performance improvements possible, although more complex.
		- Event Sourcing CQRS
			- Stores events (changes over time, rather than normalized storage of objects).
			- Allows replay events (to get to any previous, or current state).
			- Updates read database so read queries will be extremely fast.
			- Most complex (eventual consistency, higher cost to create and maintain the event sourcing features), but has most benefits.
			- Complete audit trail.
			- Any point-in-time entity reconstruction.
			- Great for load testing and debugging.
			- Can project current state of entities into more than one type of read optimized datastore (graph databases, OLAP cubes, in-memory db, lucene or any fast indexing service etc.).
			- Can rebuild production database by replaying events.
	- Again, C# example application was used, but I was only following along without coding for this one.

### Day 95: April 7, 2018

**Today's Focus**: Continued two Pluralsight courses: [Creating Web Applications With Go](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/creating-web-applications-go-update/table-of-contents) and [Clean Architecture: Patterns, Practices and Principles](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/clean-architecture-patterns-practices-principles/table-of-contents).

**Details**:
	
 - Creating Web Applications With Go
 	- Continued with creating custom file server using http.HandleFunc and manually handling different types of page types (html, css, png etc.).
	- Removed all custom code and used built-in http.ServerFile to serve up pages.
	- Added basic html template and parsing logic.
	
 - Clean Architecture: Patterns, Practices and Principles
 	- Looked at functional organization and screaming architecture (i.e. organize code by use cases instead of by architectural pattern like MVC (categorical)).
		- Easy to navigate (spatial locality).
		- Avoids vendor lock-in (based on conventions of MVC etc. for Rails or ASP.NET etc.)
		- However, you lose automatic scaffolding and framework conventions.
		- It is also easier to use categorical organization at first (e.g. following MVC conventions), but becomes more difficult as the product gets bigger.
	- Looked at mircroservices.
		- Subdivides monolithic applications into small independent domains that communicate through clearly defined interfaces.
		- Uses bounded context (recognition of a specific contextual scope within which a specific model is valid) to constrain domain models and subdivide them.
		- Communicate state transitions across boundaries from one domain to another using well defined interfaces and coordinated transactions or eventual consistency.
		- Spaghetti -> Lasagna -> Ravioli :)
	- Again, C# example application was used, but I was only following along without coding for this one.

### Day 96: April 8, 2018

**Today's Focus**: Continued two Pluralsight courses: [Creating Web Applications With Go](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/creating-web-applications-go-update/table-of-contents) and [Clean Architecture: Patterns, Practices and Principles](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/clean-architecture-patterns-practices-principles/table-of-contents).

**Details**:
	
 - Creating Web Applications With Go
 	- Looked at restructuring static html pages to using templates.
	- Used html template ParseGlob and replaced all links in the static html pages.
	
 - Clean Architecture: Patterns, Practices and Principles
 	- Looked at testable architecture.
		- Overview of many test types and how to test the various layers of a domain-centric design.
		- Looked at the Test Automation Pyramid.
	- Evolving the architecture.
		- Clean architecture: Focus on key abstractions of the domain and application logic at the center of the architecture, defer user interface, persistence, third party dependencies and cross cutting concerns to implementation details. This allows evolution to be done more easily over time.
		- Implementations details left to "Last Responsible Moment".
	- Again, C# example application was used, but I was only following along without coding for this one.
